    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <div class="intro-text-content">
      <p>Welcome to zakbnb! We live in the heart of Baltimore. Our rooms are clean, comfortable and in the center of the city. We have successfully hosted visits by our wonderful guests and still continues on.</p>

      <p> I came to the U.S. to continue my education in medicine. Currently, I am in a research program with the University of Maryland Baltimore. Around the neighborhood, you will find a bohemian style setting with private streets lined with cozy row houses. Our home is on a quiet street near the birthplace of the Bambino, Babe Ruth.</p>
  
      <p>Back at the house, we offer a warm environment. During the spring, summer, and fall, that means BBQ on our grill out the back porch. Our Pakistani spices add amazing flavor, a new experience for our BBQ fans. I will personally cook you some traditional Pakistani cuisine that will give you an international taste of our culture. 
      </p>

      <p>We also have great Wi-Fi throughout the house, no complaints about that. The shower has good water pressure and we offer a variety of higher-end toiletries to make sure you clean up good for a night on the town. We are just a five-minute walk to popular places downtown.</p>
